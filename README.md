# ProjectEuler
A repository for my Project Euler solutions done in Python as a hobby.

## Attention! ##
I strongly suggest you try look at and solve the problems yourself before thinking about other solutions like the ones you can find here. 

## Project solved so far ##
* Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
* Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
* Problem 3: Largest prime factor
